# The effect of React on web standards

React and its community and contributors have had a marked effect on the standardization and adoption of web technologies.

- TC39 Proposals
  - trailing function commas https://github.com/tc39/proposal-trailing-function-commas
  - object spread
  - public class fields (static properties, instance properties - use in React classes) https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields
  - immutable data structures (dead 2015 proposal) https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-immutable-data-structures
  - failed JSX standards proposal
  - other proposals like macros (not proposed yet): https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/883412096834301952
- React's different direction than web components
- community's tendency towards re-invention, wanting more lower-level control than current web APIs give them
  - CSS in JS, react-native-web
  - Fiber: reimplementation of the stack
- web assembly https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ocamlrun-wasm
- functional programming style (popularization of this)
- immutability
- React Core meeting notes https://twitter.com/search?q=react%20core%20meeting%20notes&src=typd
- TC39 meeting notes
- ES Modules (?)

## Inventions
- JSX
  - Future of JSX: https://github.com/facebook/jsx/issues/65
- React component model
- unidirectional data flow
- Virtual DOM

## Efforts for Integration and Cooperation with the Status Quo
- Dominic's work on using more standards within React, making React smaller
- using server-side rendering and above-the-fold rendering to optimize apps for how browsers perform best
- using web components with React
- embracing of css syntax with styled-components, etc
- glam using standards for dynamic css

## Libraries, Documentation
- mostly using new syntax and language features (often before they are completely standardized)
- examples of libraries using new web tech

## Project ideas
- Do one or more blog posts on the topic
- Create a platform to show involvement in TC39 (who represents which company eg. Facebook)
- Create a platform to track innovations driven by React (? maybe difficult)

## Feedback
- cpojer "React's direct effect on "web standards" directly is not significant - only object spread"
  - retitle talk to "web ecosystem" or something?
  - focus on the long tail (indirect effects, community effects, influence on industry)
- trueadm "lots of movement in the space"
  - Dominic's work on using more standards within React, making React smaller
  - failed JSX standards proposal
  - send abstract for further feedback
  - Twitter chat notes
  - Sebastian can offer further feedback
- svensauleau "Facebook is pushing a lot functional paradigms, types and AOT compilation"
  - FP and types don't work so well in JS (flow, immutable.JS, redux, ...) They now push reasonml for this reason
  - And Ahead Of Time compilation with prepack is also the future. Do less at runtime and more at compile time
